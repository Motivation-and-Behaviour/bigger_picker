# Data Management

## Contacting Data Custodians

Once a dataset has been [validated](../extraction_process/#overview-of-steps), we can begin contacting data custodians to request access to the data.
This process is entirely managed on [Asana](https://app.asana.com/1/653672074038961/project/1210433819516828/list/1210434509883894).

The steps are:

1. **Assign yourself to the dataset**.
   This indicates who is responsible for contacting the data custodian.
2. **Change the status of the dataset to 'Contacting Authors'**.
   This triggers Asana to create the subtasks for this dataset.
3. **Follow the subtasks**.
   You should routinely check for overdue subtasks to ensure we are following up with data custodians.

???+ tip
    You need to assign yourself to the dataset **before** changing the status.
    Asana will automatically assign the subtasks to the person assigned to the dataset.
