# Overview

## Project Overview

We are conducting a individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis to better understand the impact of screen time on children's learning, cognitive abilities, mental health, wellbeing, and behaviour.
This is part of the [Bigger Picture](https://osf.io/u38jn/) project.

To conduct an IPD meta-analysis, we need to identify datasets which contain relevant data, determine which of those datasets we will try to access, and then work with the people who manage those datasets (data custodians) to access the data.

### Identifying Datasets

We have used two methods to identify datasets:

1. Our [2023 Umbrella Review](https://rdcu.be/dqZlv), which identified 102 meta-analyses on screen time.
   We extracted the cited studies from these meta-analyses.
2. A systematic search of the literature using [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/).
   We extracted the search terms from the above meta-analyses, and the search strategy from the umbrella review, and created a single search strategy.

### Screening Articles

We need to screen the articles we have identified to determine which ones contain datasets that we want to access.
We do this using [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai/), a web-based tool for screening articles.
Full details of the screening process are in the [Screening](screening_overview.md) section of the documentation.

### Extracting Data

In order to evaluate which datasets to access, we need to extract data from the articles we have screened.
We use two tools for this: [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) for storing the data, and [Asana](https://asana.com/) for tracking the datasets.
We use a combination of automated extraction using the [Bigger Picker tool](../cli.md) and manual checking to confirm the data.
Full details of the extraction process are in the [Extraction](extraction_overview.md) section of the documentation.

### Dataset Management

Once we have decided which datasets to access, we need to work with the data custodians to access the data.
It's really important that we are systematic and organised in our approach to this, as we want to avoid duplication of effort and ensure that we are respectful of the data custodians' time.
We use [Asana](https://asana.com/) to manage our interactions with the data custodians, and to track the progress of our requests.
Full details of the dataset management process are in the [Data Management](data_management.md) section
