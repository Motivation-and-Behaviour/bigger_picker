# Screening Overview

## Overview

The purpose of screening is to identify articles that contain datasets relevant to the Bigger Picture project.
This process involves two main steps:

1. **Title and Abstract Screening**: Initial screening of articles based on their titles and abstracts to remove completely irrelevant articles.
2. **Full Text Screening**: A more detailed review of the full text of articles that passed the initial screening to determine if they contain relevant datasets.

The below outlines the process for screening articles, and the criteria we use to determine whether an article is relevant to the Bigger Picture project.

## Setup

To begin screening, you will need access to the [Bigger Picture Project](https://new.rayyan.ai/reviews/1388927/overview) on [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai/).
If you don't have access, please let Taren know.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

The below are the criteria that we use to assess whether an article is relevant to the Bigger Picture project.
You should read these carefully before beginning the screening process.
Note that you can also access these criteria in Rayyan by clicking the ![Rayyan Criteria Icon](../imgs/rayyan_criteria.png) icon in the top right corner of the screen.
